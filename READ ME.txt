With this package you can create data with custom weights meaning:
You can add some data with different weights and the Data_Logic class will take care of the weights for you.
You can add multiple weights for each class. Weights are probability -es.
They are a simple function where you can define the desired outcome as the probability from a linear version called linear_probability.
Create Trait objects at runtime and add them to your Data_Logic.
Each time you want to get a data point from your list_Data_Logic or list of data you can call the get_data_from_random.
This returns a Data_Logic element from the list with the closest number of added_probabilites.

To start working with this library first create a class which extends Data_Logic or DLContainer.
Then implement the calculation method, and add some of your custom data and your good to go.
